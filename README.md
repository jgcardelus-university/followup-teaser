Small bites üç™ of code of Followup (Core &amp; Web) for web apps

## Follow Up's architecture

Follow Up is divided into three distinct components:

1. Core
2. Web
3. Miner

Core is Follow Up's backend. A Django server that exposes a Rest API to interact with the database (Postgres).

Web is Follow Up's frontend. It's desgined for Desktops and it's written in JSX using the Remix.run framework.

Finally, Miner is Follow Up's desktop app that, as the name implies, mines the data for the program.

This repository includes small bites of code from Core and Web (which you can find in the folders with those names).
